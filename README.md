# Note-Taker

## Description
I built this application to learn about how to design the backend of a javascipt application, as well as how to connect the frontend and backend properly. I also learned how to use heroku to deploy an application. 

This is a useful tool for quickly taking and saving notes, and can be used for taking notes in class or just creating a grocery list. Currently there is no way to delete notes once you have saved them, but I will add that as a feature later.

## Usage
See screenshot below. In the middle of the page are fields where you can enter the title and text for a note. Once you have written something, a save button will appear in the upper left corner. Once a note is saved it will be added to the list on the left. The delete buttons currently do not do anything. To start a new note, click the plus button in the upper right.

## Credits
This application requires express to run, and was deployed using heroku.
